            <h3>Laotian Grilled Chicken (Ping Gai)</h3>
            <p>This particular ping gai (Laotian for 'grilled chicken') recipe seems to have originated from the Queen Mother Cafe in Toronto, so some North-Americanization may have occurred. But rest assured, this is at least twice as good as your average grilled chicken, North American or otherwise. Generous amounts of freshly ground pepper and chopped cilantro are the main players in the marinade, while a sweet, garlicky dipping sauce is the perfect accompaniment.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>¼ cup paprika</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons hot chili powder</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>4 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together lemon juice, chili powder, garlic, ginger and salt.</li>
                <li>Add chicken.</li>
                <li>Marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat.</li>
                <li>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade.</li>
                <li>Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
            </ol>
